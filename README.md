# IMY774-DistractionMaze

Distraction Maze is an immersive escape room experience that challenges the player's focus and problem-solving abilities in a dynamic, dark environment. Players find themselves in a dimly lit room filled with various tasks, each  demanding careful attention and quick thinking. Their progress in the game is tied to their focus, which resets when they give in to distraction.

## GAMEPLAY ELEMENTS:
1. Gaze-based interaction: The core mechanic is gaze-based interaction. Players must maintain direct eye contact with the task at hand to make progress. If they look away, their progress resets.
2. Task variety: Tasks range from organizing objects (e.g., arranging books by height, aligning pencils on a desk) to solving logic puzzles. Each task presents a unique challenge, testing different cognitive skills.
3. Distractions: The room is filled with distractions aimed at diverting theplayer's attention. These include insect noises, fake vibrating phonenotifications, objects moving in their peripheral vision, and intermittent narrations. Players can choose end distractions (for example, swatting at the insect, silencing the phone, telling the narrator to be quiet), but this will come at the cost of time allocated for the current task. It's a strategic decision players must make - endure the distraction or sacrifice time.
4. Movement: Players will navigate from one task area to another by walking. This will mean there is less space available, as they will have to be able to make it wherever they need to go within the boundary, but it will allow for better and more interesting interactions while they move around.
5. Narrative Element: As players progress through the maze, an unfolding storyline provides context and motivation.

## OBJECTIVES:
- Test and enhance focus, problem-solving, and time management skills.
- Encourage strategic decision-making in managing distractions.

## CLASSIFICATION
This will be built on the Oculus Quest, because I have full-time access to one, and for its hand-tracking capabilities, which will allow for more natural interaction when the user is organizing objects. This will still be a mostly
stationary experience but will at points move the user to different places in the room. This experience is meant to be mentally stimulating, to either entertain users or help them focus before doing another task.

### HAPTIC TECHNOLOGY:

I would buy a couple of small vibrating motors like these and connect them to a computer like a raspberry pi/Arduino (in a case that clipped on to the user’s waistband). I’d then attach them using bands/tape/glue to a couple key places on the user’s body, like their hands and legs, and use that to create haptic feedback without controllers. This probably wouldn’t be very comfortable/natural for a user, but I think it would be an interesting thing to attempt.
